# ImageCrawler
A utility to crawl through a specified website and download its images.

ImageCrawler does its best to go through gathered links, starting from a homepage that you set.  You can limit it to a single website or you can have it branch off in all different directions and eventually all through the web (urlLimiter paramater).  Furthermore, you can limit which site it downloads images from (imageLimiter paramater).  You can even limit it from making too many requests too fast!
